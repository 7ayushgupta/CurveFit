# Map of the Code

In this documentation, we give a high-level overview of the purpose of different parts of the code base
and how they fit together.

`CurveFit` is a package for fitting curves, and can be used to do only that if desired.
However, due to its primary usage for the IHME COVID-19 project, it has modules specifically for evaluating model 
performance out beyond the range of time observed in the data.
